# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

Repo-local instructions for agents working in this repository.

## Source Of Truth

The canonical architecture for this project lives in:

- `canonical-architecture.md`

If another document conflicts with it, follow `canonical-architecture.md`.

The design-history narrative lives in:

- `design-history/canonical-architecture-synthesis.md`

Older architecture documents now live under `design-history/` and are historical context only unless explicitly referenced for a specific comparison task.

## What This Repository Is

This repository currently holds architecture, planning, and source-of-truth documentation for an autonomous coding system.

For quick file lookup, use `REPO_MAP.md`. For reading order, use `GUIDE.md`.

It is not yet the implementation repository for the supervisor/runtime itself unless and until code is added for that purpose.

## Working Rules

1. Preserve the distinction between:
   - source-of-truth docs
   - design-history docs
2. Do not re-open settled architecture decisions casually.
3. Prefer updating `canonical-architecture.md` when the source-of-truth design changes.
4. Prefer updating `design-history/canonical-architecture-synthesis.md` only when recording meaningful design-history evolution.
5. If adding new docs, update `README.md` so future sessions can orient quickly.
6. If implementation starts in this repo, keep the runtime architecture consistent with the canonical document:
   - deterministic supervisor owns workflow correctness
   - bounded AI strategy layer owns planning/strategy only
   - Codex is sole writer
   - Playwright is sole browser owner
7. Do not treat anything under `design-history/` as authoritative unless the user explicitly asks for historical comparison.

## Current Priority

The next implementation work should align with the phased plan in `canonical-architecture.md`, starting with:

1. repo contract definition
2. deterministic supervisor foundation
3. single-writer builder loop
4. app supervisor and UI verification
5. bounded strategy API integration

## Editing Guidance

- Keep architecture statements concrete and implementation-oriented.
- Prefer structured sections over loose brainstorming.
- When changing the canonical architecture, explain the reason clearly and keep the document internally consistent.
- When in doubt, reduce ambiguity rather than adding optionality.

## Repo Working Expectations

- Use `PROJECT_INTENT.md`, `canonical-architecture.md`, `RULES.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, and `GUIDE.md` as the current truth set for purpose, architecture, constraints, placement, and navigation.
- Record active work, completed work, suggested ideas, audit records, test evidence, and feedback decisions in `todo.md` rather than leaving them only in chat.
- Keep verification evidence in `todo.md`'s `Test Evidence Log`, and keep the durable completion trail in `todo.md`'s `Completed` section.
- Keep the current-checkout bias unless the user explicitly asks for isolation or concurrent work makes a separate branch/worktree necessary.
- Ask focused clarifying questions when instructions conflict with the canonical architecture or the repo boundary; otherwise prefer direct execution over repeated approval prompts.
- Do not let unrelated tracked changes block your task. Do not revert them unless the user explicitly asks.
- Commit and push every task-touched file before finishing unless the user explicitly says not to.
